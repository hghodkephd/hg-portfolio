## Potteryverse: Studio Economics Analytics
**Stack:** Python, Pandas, Streamlit  
**Summary:** Developed a complete analytics workflow for modeling revenue and membership growth in community ceramics studios. Implemented Monte Carlo simulations to estimate break-even points, churn effects, and confidence bands for studio financial self-sufficiency.

## PhotoSorter: Image Grouping for Product Photography
**Stack:** OpenCV, scikit-learn, Pandas  
**Summary:** Built a hybrid visual + temporal clustering system to group ceramic product photos (macro and full-pot shots). Outputs a CSV mapping of image-to-group relationships, reducing manual curation time by 70%.

## Single-Molecule DNA Repair Data Analysis
**Stack:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, custom image analysis pipelines  
**Summary:** Built quantitative tools for single-molecule trajectory analysis, kinetic modeling, and statistical fitting of DNA-protein interactions. Extracts kinetic constants (kon, koff, KD) from time-series fluorescence data.
