# Welcome

Hi, I’m Harshad Ghodke — a scientist–engineer who integrates mechanistic biology with engineering principles to build functional, end-to-end systems. My work spans protein engineering, quantitative modeling, experimental design, and applied scientific computing. I focus on solving real-world problems by translating complex biological or operational challenges into robust, implementable solutions.

This portfolio includes:

Résumé: A concise overview of my scientific and engineering experience across biotech, biophysics, and process-oriented development.
	
Projects: A curated selection of applied work — from environmental monitoring systems and economic simulation tools to kinetic modeling, image analysis pipelines, and platform-level workflow design. These projects highlight my approach to building practical solutions grounded in mechanistic understanding and systems thinking.
	
Technical Artifacts: Code, notebooks, and tools illustrating how I use Python, scientific libraries, and engineering methods to move ideas from proof-of-concept to reliable operation.

Across all of my work, I emphasize clarity, rigor, and pragmatic design — building tools and systems that are both scientifically sound and operationally useful.
